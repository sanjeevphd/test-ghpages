I'm looking for a quick way to get up and running, well writing actually. 

Everytime I've tried to make a habit of writing, I end up focussing and spending time on building the site, on looks and appearances than actually generating content. Looks are important and they have their place, but content is more important and getting into a habit of writing is even more important.

So, here is attempt at getting something setup quickly, so I can get writing!

More to follow!
